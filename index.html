                          The term Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders is used to encompass Depression 
                          in the pre-partum (before), antepartum (during) and postpartum (after) periods 
                          and affects approximately 1 in 7 women for each pregnancy experience.  
                          While "Postpartum Depression" is the most known, "postpartum" in fact means "after pregnancy."
